#Express Routing Challenge
Recall that the server is running JavaScript, so our normal js code works! If statements, else, loops, variables, all that jazz. We're going to do a little validation of the data the user is POSTing to our server.

##Instructions
Take the lecture code and add some logic to our POST route on the server.

- Don't allow the user to add duplicate songs.
- Don't allow the user to add songs with a blank artist or title field.
- Before pushing to our array, add a property to the new song object for the dateAdded with the current date. You'll have to look up the Date object in javascript.
- On the client... Add the dateAdded to our DOM display for our songs.

NOTE: You're going to have to send back a status code of 400 if there are problems. That means your client code needs to be able to handle the error case and tell the user!
